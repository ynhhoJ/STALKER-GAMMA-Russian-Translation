We've located him nearby but he's with other stalkers. You need to kill them and escort him back. You'll recognize him by his rifle; an SVD. He'll unfortunately have to shoot back when you attack the group so keep that in mind.</text>

		<text>HQ nearly has a full complement of tools now. However, some of the less orthodox gear, the kind used by our military stalkers, will require even more advanced tools to get the most out of them.

		<text>Maybe when I show this to the Colonel, he'll finally crack a smile. The stalkers won't know what hit them when the time comes. If you find any more tools, be sure to visit our checkpoint in Cordon or the mobile lab in Yantar. Last I heard, the technicians there require more tools themselves.</text>

It'll let me prepare medicine for almost any potential threat or injury a soldier could encounter while out on patrol.\n \n
		Or at least, it would, but my request keeps getting postponed. Every second could save a life, so my proposition is this: if you find a decent kit, I'll pay you out of my own wallet for it, no fuss. Just bring one to me as soon as you can. </text>
