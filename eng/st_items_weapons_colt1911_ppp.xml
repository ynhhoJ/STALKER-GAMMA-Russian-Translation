		<text>An incredibly unique, custom-made 1911 marketed specifically for competition. The pistol is fitted with a trademark Strayer-Voigt magazine, a blue tritium optic and has been modified in-house to fire in 3 round bursts. However, with these competition-focused modifications, the same long-term reliability of the classic 1911 cannot be expected.\n \n

		<text>A peculiar semi-automatic pistol using .357 Magnum through the chassis of a Colt 1911. This has been accomplished by changing the barrel, slide, handle and magazine to accommodate for the caliber change. While lacking in accuracy, the recoil is tolerable as long as rapid-fire use is avoided.\n \n
