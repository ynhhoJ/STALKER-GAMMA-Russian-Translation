	<string id="mutant_part_psy_dog_brain_description">
		<text>Psi-Dogs have powerful physic abilities allowing them to induce "hallucinations" upon their prey. These illusions are extremely convincing, often capable of inflicting very real trauma through currently unknown means. Interestingly, scientists say that while they've identified the region of the brain responsible for the psionic abilities, it's evident that the region is "juvenile" in both development and evolutionary potential. Scientists will pay generously for samples of such tissues.\n \n
