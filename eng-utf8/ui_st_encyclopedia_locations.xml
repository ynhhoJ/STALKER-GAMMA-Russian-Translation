		%c[pda_white]• %c[ui_gray_2]This location was occupied by Duty as its HQ during the 2011 Faction Wars. During this time, part of the southern complex was turned into a dedicated taxidermy museum of Zone wildlife.\n

		%c[ui_gray_2]Nobody is all too sure what the intended purpose of these catacombs were, as whilst some compartments were clearly used for necessities such as plumbing, others appear distinctly scientific in nature.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]It was here on April 26th, 1986 that the first disaster occurred, after reactor 4 exploded following a power surge and failed emergency shutdown, vast plumes of radioactive materials were launched into the atmosphere.\n \n

		%c[ui_gray_2]Formerly inhabited by those who could not find a home within Limansk or Pripyat, much of the location's history has since been long forgotten. The name given to it by stalkers can be considered an accurate one, likening the city to a corpse; decaying and wasting away at the hands of the elements.

		%c[pda_green]Information\n
		%c[ui_gray_2]Although nothing is publicly known about the history of this hospital, it is safe to presume its intended purpose was to serve the residents of nearby Limansk. One of the location's most interesting features is the fact that it has somehow collapsed into the ground, as earthquakes in this part of the world are extremely uncommon and are usually so small that they go unnoticed.\n \n
		It is also the only major area within the Zone known to be absent of any radioactive or anomalous activity, however it is still dangerous for most stalkers due to being a common meeting ground for all sorts of Zone-worshipping cultists.\n \n
		%c[pda_yellow]Trivia\n
		%c[pda_white]• %c[ui_gray_2]This is one of the few locations in the Zone that Emissions and Psy-storms cannot touch.\n
		%c[pda_white]• %c[ui_gray_2]This location used to be one of the most heavily fortified places in the Zone, with machine guns and helicopters setting up kill zones along the hospital's narrow walkways.\n
		%c[pda_white]• %c[ui_gray_2]While almost none of the fortifications remain, it is speculated the hospital has since become an auxiliary temple for Monolith forces.

		However, since the Zone's ultimate inception in 2006, this area has bustled into life. Sometimes, it's the site of spates between factions. Usually, it's a breeding ground for mutants. Despite being so isolated and difficult to get to, many stalkers have noticed the vehicles here are gradually being stripped bare, with many believing that somebody, perhaps the military, is attempting to salvage the metals and illegally sell them for scrap.\n \n
