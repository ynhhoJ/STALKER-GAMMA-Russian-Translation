		<text>"I have to write this down... somehow I feel it will lessen my burden. I can only hope that someone will read this so that my legacy remains after I'm gone and no one makes the same mistakes I did. I don't have a lot of friends and I most certainly don't have any friends here in the Zone. The traders all look at me like I'm some kind of outcast. That bearded fellow in Zaton smiles sarcastically every time he sees me... and the Hawaiian trader mocks me with his easy-going attitude. Fuck those bastards. All I need from them is some ammo, food and water from time to time.\n
		I started writing this so at least someone would know what I went through that night and maybe understand why I prefer to be alone. I came here on my own but immediately paired up with this newbie. It turned out he was a mineral enthusiast. He had a hobby of collecting rocks, so naturally the artefacts unique to the Zone were his next fascination. He got so many of them I can only assume that they were what gave him that stomach tumor?. Frequent throwing up, diarrhea, stress...\n
		He was good company and I needed that at the time. We never attacked bandits, avoided most mutants and just hung around anomalies, picking interesting rocks and sometimes grabbing a few artefacts if we were lucky."</text>

		<text>"There was talk about this anomaly reportedly located deep inside a cave or fissure in the ground. There were supposed to be crazy amounts of artefacts there, but for some reason, nobody wanted to go there. We thought them cowards and fools. Why the hell wouldn't anyone jump at the chance to get rich and live an easy life? So we felt this sudden surge of courage, packed up and went directly to the cave. We didn't even manage to peer into before this dark shadow flew over us. I tripped, struck my head and blacked out.\n
		After a while I came to, and heard something or someone moaning. I thought it to be animals at first, but then I realized that it was my friend lying in front of me. I saw his skin ripped all over his body, his muscles bleeding all over, bones sticking from disgusting wounds. He was clumsily holding his now exposed guts in his hands. It was miracle he didn't die on the spot. I couldn't make sense of anything.\n
		I still had my backup pistol and I started shooting towards the darkness of the cave. I had 20 rounds in that pistol. When I still had 7 rounds left, something grabbed my hand and made me pull the trigger.  At that time I didn't even realize where my gun was pointed and where I was shooting but I couldn't stop. Suddenly the force let go of me but I was in such shock that I kept pulling the trigger a few minutes after the magazine was already empty. I knew if I'd have stopped, I would have to face what I did to my friend. I didn't even have the courage to take his dog tags. I just ran.\n
		How could I talk to someone or have another friend when the Zone could take them too? It's better to be alone. Friendship comes with a price and a risk. The short-lived warmth of friendship is not worth it if you could lose i in the worst imaginable way. I have this bump on my head now to remind me of that.\n</text>

		<text>"But guess what? You can take advantage of that better-safe-than-sorry attitude. If you wanna get nice, juicy info on the whereabouts of someone's stash, remember to choose your victim carefully. When that's done and when all preparations are complete, just fuck with them psychologically. Shoot them in the legs or arms. Get them to shit themselves. Make them feel pain until they just throw down their weapons and kneel before you. Talk to them. Be nice but firm. Helpful but persuasive. Don't kill them. They are human beings after all and the mutants are so numerous, so let's not make the Zone worse than it already is. Besides, you still want the stash, don't you? Tell them you'll cut their face off. Scare the daylight out of them. Make them think it's actually the end so that they won't even need the stash after you're done with them. They usually give it up immediately and run away."\n</text>

"Marked by the Zone," I guess. But the nightmares... they are the worst. When you experience those anomalous abominations, you lose every drop of confidence you've ever had. I can handle ten Bloodsuckers in the dead of night...but the fact these anomalies violate every single law of science is just frightening. Is it even possible?

I haven't even been close to an anomaly for the last 4 months as I've been trying to make my living through hunting. That fucking thing still reacts as if it had a mind of its own. Sometimes I wish I hadn't escaped from that burning farmstead. Maybe I'd have been of more use to everyone if I had become food for those boars. Probably not... But the boars, they are stupid fuckers too... running into Burners by the dozens. If that farmstead didn't exist, Skadovsk would be overrun by boars in a matter of days. No amount of ammo could keep them at bay. Sometimes I go to Zaton to watch the fireworks, even though the skin on my back hurts so much I can barely wear my backpack. Because of that wretched scar on my back, I have to sleep on my stomach or sides. I hate sleeping on my sides, I've always been a back sleeper.

When threatened, they demonstrate extremely violent behavior, so it is advisable to approach with great care and caution.\n

		<text>"Our findings could provide the basis for a valid explanation as to why, after being shot numerous times, they are capable of functioning almost indefinitely. Walking is usually impeded, running is completely out of the question, but the reflex of aiming and firing weapons seems unaffected. Please abstain from using the terms "kill" or "destroy" when referring to the deactivation of a specimen. This stems from the psychological argument that the term "deactivation" is more neutral than "destruction" and can serve as a way of distancing ourselves from the seemingly human form they manage to maintain and of suppressing the feeling of remorse after "deactivating" a specimen. Deactivation requires physically severing the link to their motor system. This would entail inflicting damage to the brain or spinal area, preferably by means of ballistic trauma. Every member of the scientific team should bear in mind that their limbs will remain mobile even after deactivation. Therefore, special precautions are advised."\n</text>

		<text>"In extremely rare cases, certain "zombies" exhibit behavior reminiscent of more sophisticated animals such as dropping their weapons or refusing to engage in a fight. These specimens are of great value to our research, hence deactivation is not advised. Isolation and further analysis in laboratories is of utmost importance. Neuropsychologists are an especially interested party due to the potential for brain stem transplants that could theoretically aid patients in late stages of Alzheimer's and other diseases. Whenever possible, avoid damaging kidneys and the heart upon deactivation as these organs possess immense potential provided transplants ever prove viable. Harvesting organs from immobile "zombies" is also a possibility, however it is recommended to be cautious of local stalkers who might have emotional ties to some specimens. If an encounter with a stalker is unavoidable while harvesting, there are two courses of action that can be taken in order to minimize the chance of conflict. First, when dealing with inexperienced stalkers, showing them the eyes of a given specimen has proven very effective, especially since the pupils are completely unresponsive and the eyeballs appear inhuman. Secondly, more seasoned stalkers are usually easier to be reasoned with as they can better suppress emotions. However, it is still advisable to make use of psychological expertise when dealing with the local human population as in some cases, rational communication is completely out of the question."</text>

All it took was a few years of scrounging a living, surviving in this hellhole. Now, the military goons that wanted me dead have to salute me. "Yes sir", they say. "No, sir. Three bags full, sir". They do whatever I ask. It's unreal. Even Spetsnaz and OMON treat me with respect, and yet if I met them last week they wouldn't have hesitated to put a bullet between my eyes.\n
		So now, they outfit me with the best armor they have. The best weapons. The best gadgets and provisions. I eat like a king now, and today's the first time I haven't felt sick in years. I even make enough cash to send some back to the wife. But there's just one catch. I'm not allowed to let regular stalkers come up to me while I work. My commander says if they get too close, I am expected to open fire immediately. Well, all my stalker friends are already dead, so it's not like I'll be capping anyone I know, but I do wonder...

		<text>"Nikolai, I've just got back from my trip to the center of the Zone. It was hell. The Monolith and the army are still going at it, bent on exterminating each other for no reason. One moment it looked like they would conclude a cease-fire, but eventually nothing came of it. Constant havoc and destruction followed and I didn't have any other choice but to escape from this place. I almost got killed once, freaking psycho bastards. But I don't  blame them. It's entirely my fault. I just wasn't paying attention when it mattered most. This way or another, after some hardships, I made my way to Pripyat and I plan to lie low here for a while. Getting back to what we discussed previously, it seems like we're gonna have to put off our mission until it gets safer out there. I didn't get a moment of sleep after I got back, but I wanted to let you know I'm good, at least physically. We'll stay in touch."\n</text>

		<text>"We actually came here to retrieve info from Lab X-8 which is located near the Yubileiny service center north of here. Inside, there was an elevator that allowed us to go down to "-1 floor", but we got interrupted by the fucking Monolith. It's because of them that we've ended up this deep in shit. Dushman's going to kill us anyway but maybe there are a few documents left. We'd have something useful to leave with, at least. I'd head over there again with the guys but there aren't many of us left and it'd be too much to handle. We'd rather not spend any more manpower than we need to while trying to somehow get away from the center of the fucking Zone. Maybe you could head down to X-8... there could be something left and... well... you'll earn some good money at the same time."\n</text>
